# Snakes-Apples-Game
This game was developed in collaboration with a team member. The game utilizes various search algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), A* Search (A*), and Greedy Best-First Search (GBS), to navigate the snake towards the apples efficiently.

Features
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all possible paths uniformly to find the shortest path to the apple.
A Search (A):** Combines the uniform-cost search and heuristic information to find the optimal path more efficiently.
Greedy Best-First Search (GBS): Uses heuristic information to guide the search towards the apple quickly, though not necessarily the shortest path.
Project Highlights
Collaborative Effort: Developed in collaboration with [Team Member's Name].
Algorithm Comparisons: Demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of different search algorithms in the context of a game environment.
Educational Value: Ideal for those interested in understanding search algorithms and their practical applications.
