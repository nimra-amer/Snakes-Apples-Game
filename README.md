# Snakes-Apples-Game
This repository contains the "Snakes and Apples" game, developed with a team member for the Artificial Intelligence course. The game uses search algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), A* Search (A*), and Greedy Best-First Search (GBS) to efficiently navigate the snake towards the apples.
